        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I enjoy reading books, especially novels and self-help books. Reading gives me a sense of relaxation and helps me learn new things about the world and myself. Additionally, I love playing the guitar during my free time, and I plan to buy a new guitar next year to improve my skills further.</p>

        <h2>Campus Life</h2>
        <p>During my time at UTHM, I actively participated in a variety of events and programs, including extracurricular activities like the Reserve Officer Training Unit (ROTU). Being part of ROTU was an enriching experience that pushed me beyond my comfort zone. Through this program, I had the opportunity to engage in challenging outdoor activities, such as hiking, shooting practice, and survival training. Along the way, I made lasting friendships with fellow cadets who share a passion for adventure and personal growth. Together, we embraced every challenge, and these experiences have become some of my most treasured memories at UTHM. </p>
